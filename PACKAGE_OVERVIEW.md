## 📚 LEARNING STRATEGIES USED

### 1. Spaced Repetition
Every session starts with 5-minute review of all previous weeks' content. Science shows this increases memory retention by 70%.

### 2. Multi-Sensory Learning
Activities include:
- **SEEING:** Videos, pictures, diagrams
- **HEARING:** Explanations, discussions, reading aloud
- **TOUCHING:** Digging, making fossils, handling replicas
- **DOING:** Games, races, sorting, writing

### 3. Retrieval Practice
Weekly quizzes and two full mock tests. Testing actually HELPS learning, not just measures it.

### 4. Active Learning
Not lecture-based! Games, relays, hands-on experiments, and discussions keep kids engaged.

### 5. Clear Objectives
Each week has specific learning goals so students know exactly what to master.
