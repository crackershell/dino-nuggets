### Session Activities (60 minutes)

**Intro (10 min):**
- Show images of all 15 dinos; ask: "What makes each special?"
- Introduce concepts: diet (what they eat), era (when they lived), defense/traits

**Teaching (15 min):**
- **Diet Basics:** Carnivore = meat-eater (sharp teeth, claws); Herbivore = plant-eater (flat teeth, long neck); Omnivore = both
- **Era Timeline:** Triassic (oldest, 250-200 mya) → Jurassic (200-135 mya) → Cretaceous (newest, 135-66 mya)
- Show pictures of dino teeth, claws, horns; correlate to diet

**Hands-On Activity (25 min): Dino Sorting Relay**
1. Print 15 dinosaur cards (name + silhouette + trait clue on each)
2. Create 6 sorting stations on floor/table:
   - **Triassic Carnivore** | **Triassic Herbivore**
   - **Jurassic Carnivore** | **Jurassic Herbivore**
   - **Cretaceous Carnivore** | **Cretaceous Herbivore**
3. Teams (2-4 kids) grab one card, run to correct bin, race back
4. Fastest + 100% accuracy wins round

**Assessment (10 min):** 10-Question Matching Quiz
- Example: "Which dino had a club tail?" → Ankylosaurus
- "Stegosaurus was a ___ because it had flat teeth"
- Score: 80%+ = Ready; <80% = Review cards

### Materials & Print Resources

## Week 2: Fossil Formation & Types

### Learning Objectives
Students will understand fossilization processes (burial → preservation → exposure), classify 5 fossil types by characteristics, and explain why fossils are rare.

### Core Content: Fossil Types & Formation

#### Fossilization Process (Simple Steps)
1. **Death & Rapid Burial:** Organism dies, quickly covered by sediment (sand/mud)
2. **Decay Prevention:** Anaerobic (no-air) environment stops normal decomposition
3. **Preservation:** Minerals replace organic material (permineralization) OR mineral-rich water fills spaces (mold/cast)
4. **Rock Formation:** Layers compress; sediment hardens into rock (lithification)
5. **Exposure:** Erosion or digging reveals fossil in rock layers

#### 5 Fossil Types & Their Characteristics

| Fossil Type | Definition | How It Forms | Example | Looks Like |
|------------|-----------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| **Body Fossil** | Actual organism part preserved | Rapid burial + mineralization | Dinosaur bone, trilobite shell | Real bone/shell in rock |
| **Mold** | Hollow impression in rock | Organism dissolves; empty space remains | Snail shell outline | Empty cavity |
| **Cast** | Rock filling mold; replica of organism | Minerals fill mold; hardens | Plaster of dinosaur footprint | Solid copy |
| **Trace Fossil** | Evidence of organism behavior, not body | Preserved footprints, burrows, coprolites | T. rex footprint, dinosaur poop | Imprint in rock |
| **Carbonized Film** | Thin carbon layer showing outline | Heat/pressure drive off elements, leave carbon | Leaf outline, insect wing | Thin dark line on rock |

### Session Activities (60 minutes)

**Intro (5 min):**
- Show real fossil pic; ask: "Is this the real bone or a copy? How can we tell?"
- Build suspense: "Let's make fossils today!"

**Demo #1: Mold & Cast (20 min)**
1. **Materials:** Modeling clay, plaster of paris, water, small container, shells/toy
2. **Steps:**
   - Press shell into clay → Remove → You have a **mold** (the hollow)
   - Mix plaster per package; pour into mold → Let dry → Remove → You have a **cast** (the replica)
3. **Discuss:** "In nature, shells dissolve, leaving molds. Minerals fill molds and harden into casts."

**Demo #2: Rapid Burial Simulation (8 min)**
1. **Materials:** Clear jar, sand, toy dinosaur, water
2. **Steps:**
   - Layer sand at bottom; place dino; cover with more sand (rapid burial)
   - Add water → Sediment becomes cement-like
3. **Discuss:** "Without rapid burial, bacteria eat the bones. With burial, no air = no decay."

**Classification Activity (20 min): Fossil Type Card Sort**
1. Print 10 fossil images/descriptions:
   - "A T. rex tooth in gray rock" → **Body Fossil**
   - "Hollow snail shape in limestone" → **Mold**
   - "Dinosaur footprint in sandstone" → **Trace Fossil**
   - "Exact replica of trilobite (mineral-filled)" → **Cast**
   - "Thin black leaf outline on shale" → **Carbonized Film**
2. Kids sort cards into 5 piles by type
3. Check: "Why is a footprint a trace fossil?" → "No body part; it's behavior evidence"

**Assessment (7 min):** Diagram Labeling Quiz
- Show fossil cross-section diagram
- Label: mold, cast, sediment layer, original organism
- Short answer: "Why can't all dead dinos become fossils?" → Answers: slow decay, no burial, exposure to air

### Materials & Resources
- **Plaster mold/cast demo kit** (~$10 online or craft store)
- **Free fossil images:** https://ansp.org/~/media/Files/ans/programs/paleopalooza-2020/Trace%20Fossil%20Vs%20Body%20Fossil.ashx?la=en
- **Classification guide:** https://australian.museum/learn/teachers/learning/fossil-classification/
- **Clay, shells, water, containers**

### Take-Home Assignment
Write 2 sentences: "Why don't all dinosaurs become fossils? Give 2 reasons." (Hint: speed of burial, no predators, water needed)

---

## Week 3: Geologic Time Scale & Extinction

### Learning Objectives
Students will place dinosaurs on a timeline spanning 250 million years, understand each era's characteristics, and explain extinction theories with evidence.

### Core Content: Mesozoic Era Breakdown

#### Geologic Time Scale (Simplified)

| Era | Period | Time (mya) | Duration | Key Dinos | Climate | Continents |
|-----|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Mesozoic** | **Triassic** | 250-200 | 50 my | Coelophysis, Plateosaurus | Hot, dry | Connected |
| | **Jurassic** | 200-135 | 65 my | Diplodocus, Stegosaurus, Allosaurus | Warm, humid | Splitting |
| | **Cretaceous** | 135-66 | 69 my | T. rex, Triceratops, Velociraptor | Tropical | Separated |

**Key Facts by Era:**

**Triassic (First Dinosaurs)**
- "Age of Reptiles" begins
- Dinos are small to medium (Coelophysis = 9 ft)
- Mammals appear but tiny
- Pangaea supercontinent still connected
- Many dinos have 4 legs (early forms)

**Jurassic (Dinosaur Peak)**
- Largest land animals ever (Brachiosaurus = 85 ft)
- Horns/plates evolve for defense (Stegosaurus)
- Birds evolve (Archaeopteryx = half-bird, half-dino)
- Atlantic Ocean opens; continents drift
- Tropical climate; no polar ice

**Cretaceous (Diversity & Extinction)**
- Most dino variety: horns (Triceratops), crests (Parasaurolophus), armor (Ankylosaurus)
- Flowering plants appear; dinos eat flowers
- T. rex dominates late Cretaceous
- **66 million years ago: Extinction event** (asteroid impact + volcanism)

#### Extinction Theories (K-Pg Boundary)

| Theory | Evidence | Impact | Age |
|--------|----------|--------|-----|
| **Asteroid Impact** | Iridium layer in rocks; crater in Mexico (Chicxulub) | Instant darkness, global winter, starvation | 66 mya |
| **Volcanism** | Massive lava flows in India (Deccan Traps) | Ash blocks sun, toxic gases, acid rain | 66 mya |
| **Combined** | Both happened at same time | Double punch: impact + volcanic winter | 66 mya |
| **Survivor: Birds** | Birds have feathers, hollow bones, fast metabolism | Survived by eating seeds, hiding; modern birds = flying dinosaurs | Still alive! |

### Session Activities (60 minutes)

**Intro (10 min):**
- Show video clip: Asteroid hitting Earth (YouTube: "K-Pg asteroid animation")
- Ask: "Why did big dinos die but birds survived?"

**Timeline Build Activity (25 min)**
1. **Materials:** 6-meter-long roll of paper (1 meter = 50 million years)
2. **Steps:**
   - Mark lines for Triassic (0-50), Jurassic (50-115), Cretaceous (115-184 on paper)
   - Kids draw/place dino cards on timeline by era
   - Add labels: "Hot/Dry," "Tropical," dino names
3. **Walk timeline:** "Coelophysis was here (early). Brachiosaurus here (200 mya). T. rex here (near end)."

**Extinction Evidence Sorting (15 min):**
1. **Materials:** 8 evidence cards (iridium, shocked quartz, crater, lava flows, darkness, starvation, temperature drop, mass death)
2. **Sort by cause:**
   - **Asteroid:** iridium layer, crater in Mexico, shocked quartz
   - **Volcanism:** lava flows, ash clouds
   - **Effect on life:** darkness, cold, starvation, mass death
3. **Debrief:** "Iridium is rare on Earth but common in space meteors. Finding iridium = proof!"

**Assessment (10 min):** Multiple-Choice Quiz
- "Which period had the biggest dinos?" → Jurassic
- "T. rex lived in which era?" → Cretaceous
- "What caused non-bird dinos to go extinct?" → Asteroid/volcanism
- "What evidence proves an asteroid hit?" → Iridium layer / crater

### Materials & Resources
- **Timeline paper/roll:** Butcher paper + markers
- **Geologic timescale:** https://paos.colorado.edu/~fasullo/1060/resources/geo_time.html
- **Free extinction video:** YouTube "Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction 66 million years ago"
- **Dino cards from Week 1** (reuse)

### Take-Home Assignment
Draw timeline with 3 eras. Mark 2 dinos in each era + write 1 fact per era (e.g., "Triassic: first dinos appeared").

## Week 4: Paleontology Tools & Famous Fossil Sites

### Learning Objectives
Students will learn how paleontologists work (tools, methods, sites), match fossils to locations, and conduct a simulated dig.

### Core Content: Paleontology Essentials

#### Paleontologist Tools & Their Uses

| Tool | Use | Why |
|------|-----|-----|
| **Brush** (soft paintbrush) | Gently remove sediment from fossil | Don't damage delicate bones |
| **Chisel/Hammer** | Break rock around fossil | Careful tapping, not smashing |
| **Sieve/Screen** | Filter sediment to find small bones/teeth | Sorts by size |
| **Measuring tape** | Record fossil position/depth | Tracks layer dating |
| **Trowel** | Scoop sediment in layers | Preserves context |
| **Magnifying glass** | Examine details of small fossils | Identify species |
| **Excavation grid** | Map exact location in grid squares | Archaeological precision |

#### Famous Fossil Sites & What They Contain

| Site Name | Location | Era/Period | Famous Fossils | Found |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Hell Creek Formation** | Montana/Wyoming, USA | Late Cretaceous | T. rex, Triceratops, small mammals | 1902-present |
| **Morrison Formation** | Colorado/Wyoming, USA | Late Jurassic | Brachiosaurus, Diplodocus, Allosaurus | 1877-present |
| **Yixian Formation** | China | Early Cretaceous | Feathered dinos (Sinosauropteryx), birds | 1996-present |

## Tips for Success

1. **Consistency:** Same time/day weekly builds routine (Saturday 1 hour)
2. **Engagement:** Rotate who leads activities; celebrate effort, not just correctness
3. **Differentiation:** Advanced kids → harder short-answer questions; struggling kids → extra drill on weak areas
4. **Practice Retrieval:** Start each session with 5-min flashcard drill (spaced repetition = retention)
5. **Home Engagement:** Parents receive take-home assignments; ask kids to teach concepts to family
6. **Visual Learning:** Use skeleton images, timeline, fossil pictures (kids are visual)
7. **Confidence Building:** "You know this!" on test day trumps stress

---

## Parent/Guardian Communication Template

**Email Week 1:** "This week we learned 15 dinosaurs by diet and time period. Your child can sort cards at home to practice. Check if they know T. rex is Cretaceous carnivore!"

**Email Week 5:** "Mock test coming up! Your child did great on dino ID but needs review on fossil types. Ask them to explain what a mold is."

**Email Before Event:** "Saturday is the big day! Your child is ready. Remind them to read carefully and show work. Have fun!"

---

## Good Luck!

Your students are **fully prepared** with specific dinosaurs, fossil types, geologic periods, and paleontology knowledge. The combination of 6 weeks of hands-on learning, two full-length mock tests, and targeted review builds both knowledge AND confidence for competition day.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 80%+ accuracy on practice tests
- Confident dinosaur/fossil identification
- Understanding of why dinosaurs are extinct and how paleontologists work
- Ready for **NC Science Olympiad Division A – Dino Nuggets Event**
